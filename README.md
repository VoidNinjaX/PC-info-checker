# PC Info Collector

## What It Does
The **PC Info Collector** is a Python tool that gathers detailed system information, including your PC’s name, operating system, CPU, memory, disk space, and IP address. The collected data is saved into a file (`PC_info.txt`) for easy review. The script also includes progress bars, a live clock, and loading animations for a dynamic user experience. At the end, it invites you to visit [Zulu Studios' GitHub](https://github.com/ZuluStudiosInc).

## How It Works
1. **Collects PC Info**: Gathers data on your hardware, operating system, and network.
2. **Displays Progress**: Simulates downloading and saving data with progress bars and animations.
3. **Saves to File**: Outputs the information to `PC_info.txt`.
4. **Promotes GitHub**: Encourages users to visit the Zulu Studios GitHub page for more projects.

## How to Use It
1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/ZuluStudiosInc/PC-Info-Collector.git
   cd PC-Info-Collector
   

2. Install dependencies:
  
   pip install psutil
   

3. Run the script:
   
   python main.py
  

4. View the collected system data in the `PC_info.txt` file.
